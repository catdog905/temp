Dear Mike!

I've just received a letter from you! I am so glad to hear that you have
entered the university! Congratulations to you and your family. As for me, I
started learning c++ two weeks ago. It turns out c++ is very painful! Of
course, I donâ€™t work in a large company with a lot of tasks and code legacy,
but project deadline still make themselves felt. If I practice enough, Google will take me to an internship. By the way, how is your learning machine learning? I saw your performance. I think your project will become very popular.

See you soon
